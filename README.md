Sample File "8524912.jpg" image of brown bear

This modle will help identify if a picture is either an American black bear (Ursus americanus) or aa brown bear (Ursus arctos). Both live in the North Western United States and both deserve space away from people. However American black bears are legally allowed to be hunted in this region while brown bears in the lower 48 (or Grizzly bears as they are also known) are federally protected.
